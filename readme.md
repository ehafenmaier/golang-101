# Go language 101
Learning to program with the Go language. The **Hello World** and **Cards** projects are 
from the Udemy course [***Go: The Complete Developer's Guide***](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Xzy3@sLnIUzctBBQGBPVAGtwXSNuUSUeJvsDT7YT1srtaIuiuyQttgpAoZWFCMkoKc92I/) by ***Stephen Grider***.  
## Hello World
The tried and true starter program. Main takeaways from this classic:
- The overall structure of a Go file with ***package***, ***import*** and function locations
- Declaring **package main** signifies to the Go compiler that this will be an executable file
  instead of a reusable library
- If **package main** is declared then a **main()** function is required and will be the function
  that is executed
- The **import** statement allows other reusable library packages to be used within the file
## Cards
This is the Go program that will be built during the bulk of the Udemy course.
