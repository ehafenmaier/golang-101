# Go language 101
Learning to program with the Go language. Most projects are 
from the Udemy course [***Go: The Complete Developer's Guide***](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Xzy3@sLnIUzctBBQGBPVAGtwXSNuUSUeJvsDT7YT1srtaIuiuyQttgpAoZWFCMkoKc92I/) by ***Stephen Grider***.  
## Hello World
The tried and true starter program. Main takeaways from this classic:
- The overall structure of a Go file with ***package***, ***import*** and function locations
- Declaring **package main** signifies to the Go compiler that this will be an executable file
  instead of a reusable library
- If **package main** is declared then a **main()** function is required and will be the function
  that is executed
- The **import** statement allows other reusable library packages to be used within the file
## Cards
Go program that will be built during the first part of the Udemy course. Main takeaways:
- Creating custom types
- Import and use of standard packages from golang.org
- What "slices" are and how to interact with them (Similar to arrays)
- Syntax for declaring functions:
  - Receivers (Similar cocept to extension methods in C#)
  - Input paramters
  - Multiple return objects
- Syntax for creating a for loop using the ***range*** keyword
  - Using the index as well as the object in the slice
  - Ignoring the index by using the underscore
## Even & Odd
Short assignment during the course to write a small program that lists out the numbers 0 to 10 and print beside the number if it is even or odd. Simple use of a for loop and the modulus operator.
## Structs
Go program to demonstrate the creation and use of structs.
